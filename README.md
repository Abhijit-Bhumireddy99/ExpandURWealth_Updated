# ExpandUrWealth: securities investments and financial learning website 

Implemented a basic design of static and partially dynamic stock market and learning resources website by applying various web technologies such as HTML5, EJS, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js

Rendered the website content through EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) view engine instead of HTML view engine. So, I am unable to provide the public website link.

npm run devStart => to start the website local host server (port :3000)

sudo lsof -i :3000 => to check any ongoing processes on local host server port :3000

kill -9 Process_ID => to kill or delete the current process from the local host server port

http://127.0.0.1:3000/ => to view website
